## Supported Versions

Due to the fact that I do the project alone, I only support the latest major version of the project.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| 2.x     | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I ask you to report vulnerabilities as a direct message to GhostZero#0001 in Discord.  
Alternatively, an email can be sent to rene@preuss.io, but I very rarely check my emails.
